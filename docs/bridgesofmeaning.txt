@everyone crowd sourcing the server for some volunteers/expert input
The world has moved forward to the point where IN PERSON meetups are possible again, and needed more than ever.
Our original tool "buckos in space" was a decent start, but does not contain good tools for organizing and contacting the people that registered on the map. 
Eventually we will need local hosts, but right now I'm trying to find people that have some expertise in Online organization tools. If you'd like to volunteer, please respond with one of the numbers below
