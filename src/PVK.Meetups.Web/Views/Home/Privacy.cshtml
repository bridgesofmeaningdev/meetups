</p>
<p>
    By using the Services offered by @ViewData["AppName"], you’re acknowledging you have agreed to our Terms of Use and that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>What We Collect and Receive</h2>
<p>
    In order for you to create an account on @ViewData["AppName"] and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information you provide by completing forms on @ViewData["AppName"] - your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details. We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through @ViewData["AppName"], or if you contact us;</li>
        <li>Information about your activity on and interaction with @ViewData["AppName"], including use of our mobile apps (such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, and your actions on the Site);</li>
        <li>Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Site, in the form of traffic analytics.</li>
        <li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</li>
        <li>Information that you submit on or to @ViewData["AppName"] in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.</li>
        <li>You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services. You may review, change or remove your information through your account settings.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
<p>
    We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>To keep your account secure and protect our Services (including to verify the identities of customers and prevent fraud and abuse);</li>
    <li>To enable us to provide you with our Services, and to improve and promote our Services;</li>
    <li>To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on @ViewData["AppName"]; and</li>
    <li>To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can improve how @ViewData["AppName"] is performing and provide users with the best experience possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>European Union Users</h2>
<p>
    Data protection law in Europe requires a “lawful basis” for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable group leaders to establish and organize their groups, and enable sire users to find and make use of those groups.</li>
        <li>Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our Services.</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
</p>

<p>
    We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
</p>

<h2>How This Information Is Shared</h2>

<h3>Information that’s shared publicly</h3>
<p>
When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on @ViewData["AppName"]. Your username appears with the comments you post and messages you send on @ViewData["AppName"] and people can click your username to view it. Others will be able to see the following things:

<ul>
<li>The account username you select, and the date the account was created;</li>
<li>Any information you choose to add to your profile (like a picture or about information);</li>
<li>You can modify or delete certain information associated with your account (such as your profile image or about information) from your account settings.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Information that isn’t shared publicly</h3>
<p>
The following data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:
<ul>
<li>Any payment information you provide;</li>
<li>Your password details;</li>
<li>Your IP address;</li>
<li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem).</li>
<li>Information that’s shared with trusted third-party services</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote, or protect @ViewData["AppName"]’s Services (like when we partner with payment processors, or use services that help us manage our ads on other sites). When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the @ViewData["AppName"] Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we’ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do. We may also share information that’s aggregated and anonymized in a way that it doesn’t directly identify you.
</p>
<p>
We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect @ViewData["AppName"]’s legal rights, property, or the safety of @ViewData["AppName"], its employees, users, or others.
</p>

<h3>Links to other websites and services</h3>
<p>
Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from @ViewData["AppName"]’s. When you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.
</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect @ViewData["AppName"]’s legal rights.
</p>
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Because @ViewData["AppName"] is a USA-based company, your information will be collected and processed in the USA. USA has its own laws governing data protection and government access to information. The rules that protect your personal information under USA law may be different than in your home country. If you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between @ViewData["AppName"] and its users.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information. While these rights are not applicable globally, all @ViewData["AppName"] users can manage their personal information in their account settings.
</p>
<p>
To modify or delete the personal information you’ve provided to us, please log in and update your profile. You may also delete your account from your account settings page. We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
</p>

<h2>Email and Mobile Notifications</h2>
<p>
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We try to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt in to any marketing communications we send.
</p>
<p>
We will send you email relating to your transactions on @ViewData["AppName"]. You may also elect to receive certain marketing email communications, in accordance with your preferences, and from which you may opt out at any time by adjusting your notification settings.
</p>
<p>
We’ll also send you service-related announcements when it’s necessary to do so.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We take security seriously, and the security of your personal data is important to us. We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the internet. No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so @ViewData["AppName"] cannot guarantee its absolute security. Your account information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and keep secure.
